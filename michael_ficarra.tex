	{}   &   Caja is a Google project, the goal of which is to transform
	untrusted JavaScript into JavaScript that can be safely run in a
	trusted environment. Determined why popular JS libraries would not
	compile and proposed fixes to both the Caja and library developers.

	{}   &   {\em Web Application Developer, Solstice Technologies \hfill January 2008 to August 2010} \\
	{}   &   Worked on and managed projects that require the use of a
	server-side scripting language, most commonly PHP, and a database such
	as MySQL. Projects are taken from basic concept to finished product
	through collaboration and teamwork with fellow employees.
	\\ \\
	{}   &   {\em Intern, Skarven Enterprises, Berkeley Heights, NJ \hfill May to August 2009} \\
	{}   &   Designed and implemented a custom programming language to be
	used by people with little prior knowledge of programming languages to
	create integration tests for the company's main product. The compiler
	and interpreter for the custom language were written entirely in Ruby
	and on a Linux OS.
