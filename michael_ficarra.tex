  \sectiontitle{Experience}
      &  {\em Google Caja Intern, Google Summer of Code 2010 \hfill May to August 2010} \\
  {}  &  Caja is a Google project whose goal is to allow rich web aplications to safely embed untrusted third-party
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Caja allows communication between modules through exchanges of references to JS
  objects, relying on an object-capability model for security. Determined why the behaviour of popular JS libraries
  was not being preserved, and proposed fixes to both the Caja and library developers.
  \\~\\
  {}  &  {\em Web Application Developer, Solstice Technologies \hfill January 2008 to August 2010} \\
  {}  &  Worked on and managed projects that required the use of server-side scripting languages, most commonly PHP, and
  a relational database such as MySQL\@. Projects were taken from concept to completion through collaboration and teamwork
  with fellow employees.
  \\~\\
  {}  &  {\em Intern, Skarven Enterprises, Berkeley Heights, NJ \hfill May to August 2009} \\
  {}  &  Designed and implemented a custom, domain-specific programming language to be used by people with little prior
  knowledge of programming languages so they could create integration tests for the company's main product. The compiler
  and interpreter for the custom language were written in Ruby.
