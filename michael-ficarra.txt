Experience

  Application Security Engineer, Groupon                                     since September 2012
    Augmented various development teams to keep a security eye on their design and implementation.
    Built a variety of tools and services to help prevent many kinds of fraud and abuse. Redesigned
    and led implementation of core authentication mechanism as dedicated service.

  CoffeeScript Fellow, Groupon                                            June to September, 2012
    Designed and built an alternative CoffeeScript compiler with an improved compilation strategy, a
    declarative specification, and standardised interfaces. Contributed to other FOSS projects that
    were used as dependencies, including adding source map support to the most popular JavaScript
    code generator.

  Google Caja Intern, Google Summer of Code 2010                              May to August, 2010
    Caja is a Google project whose goal is to allow rich web aplications to safely embed untrusted
    third-party HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Caja allows communication between modules through
    exchanges of references to JS objects, relying on an object-capability model for security.
    Determined why the behaviour of popular JS libraries was not being preserved, and proposed ﬁxes
    to both the Caja and library developers.

  Web Application Developer, Solstice Technologies                    January 2008 to August 2010
    Worked on and managed projects that required the use of server-side scripting languages, most
    commonly PHP, and a relational database such as MySQL. Projects were taken from concept to
    completion through collaboration and teamwork with fellow employees.

  Intern, Skarven Enterprises                                                 May to August, 2009
    Designed and implemented a custom, domain-speciﬁc programming language to be used by people with
    little prior knowledge of programming languages so they could create integration tests for the
    company's main product. The compiler and interpreter for the custom language were written in
    Ruby.
