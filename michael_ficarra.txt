Experience

  Google Caja Intern, Google Summer of Code 2010                     May to August 2010
    Caja is a Google project whose goal is to allow rich web aplications to safely em-
    bed untrusted third-party HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Caja allows communication
    between modules through exchanges of references to JS objects, relying on an object-
    capability model for security. Determined why the behaviour of popular JS libraries
    was not being preserved, and proposed ﬁxes to both the Caja and library developers.

  Web Application Developer, Solstice Technologies          January 2008 to August 2010
    Worked on and managed projects that required the use of server-side scripting lan-
    guages, most commonly PHP, and a relational database such as MySQL. Projects
    were taken from concept to completion through collaboration and teamwork with
    fellow employees.

  Intern, Skarven Enterprises, Berkeley Heights, NJ                  May to August 2009
    Designed and implemented a custom, domain-speciﬁc programming language to be
    used by people with little prior knowledge of programming languages so they could
    create integration tests for the company's main product. The compiler and interpreter
    for the custom language were written in Ruby.
